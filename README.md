# PyBer_Analysis
1. Overview of the analysis-
The purpose of this analysis was to find the generated fare amounts throughout the year for different city types. We ploted this in the graph and each point in the graph represented weekly fare amount generated by each city types.

2. Results-
 - We found that count of drivers decreases as we go from urban to suburban to rural
 - Average cost per ride increases as we go from urban to suburban followed by rural 
 - Which in return generates more money per ride for the drivers in rural cities compared to suburban as well as urban

 code used for analysis- \
 total_driver = city_data_df.groupby(["type"]).sum()["driver_count"] \
 total_driver

- However, we also found that the total daily trips in urban city types are much higher than compared to suburban and rural thus total generated fare amount is highest in urban then in suburban followed by rural

  code used for analysis- \
  total_ride = pyber_data_df.groupby(["type"]).count()["ride_id"] \
  total_ride \

  Rural        125 \
  Suburban     625 \
  Urban       1625 \

  total_fare_amount = pyber_data_df.groupby(["type"]).sum()["fare"] \
  total_fare_amount \
  type \
  Rural        4327.93 \
  Suburban    19356.33 \
  Urban       39854.38 \
  Name: fare, dtype: float64


- In deliverable 2 we further deepened our analysis by looking at daily / weekly generated fare amounts per city types, by considering 4 months of data, which aligned with our previous analysis implying even when the cost per ride was higher in suburban than urban, and highest in rural cities, urban cities were generating considerally higher amount of wealth due to higher ride counts.

3. Summary-
- Provided the ride fare is higher as we move out of urban cities, one way to bridge the gap between the number rides taken in urban cities vs suburban or rural is to decrease the fare amounts
- Another way is to see if we can increase drivers in rural regions thus increasing availability for customers to pursue ride share
- Lastly, we could possibly increase the fare amounts in urban areas
